# OMniLeads Deploy Tools

This repository provides different methods to run OMniLeads:

- Ansible: to launch the application using systemd on any modern Linux instance with Podman support.
This format is very similar to the method used in OMniLeads 1.X

- docker-compose: to launch the application on your local machine, ideal to obtain an instance of
the application practically without configuration. This format is purely for testing.
